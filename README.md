## JobsPatrol
Some of the best jobs I had were found just by finding the listing on their website. Unfortunately the link to a jobs page is often hidden away at the bottom of a page or in some menu where I have to go find it intentionally. This is where JobsPatrol comes in, it checks for those pages with the use of AI and complex algorithms and lets you know when it finds one. Easy.
